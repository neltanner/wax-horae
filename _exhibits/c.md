# The Book of Hours: Simple pious reading for women?

Both men and women read the Books of Hours, although there are some who still insist that they were primarily the favourite devotional reading for women in their homes. However, this assumption requires some clarification: in Lacité des dames, written at the very beginning of the 15th century, Christine de Pisan painted a picture of the sincere piety of women and noted that they read Books of Hours not only in their homes but also took them to church rather than a missal.

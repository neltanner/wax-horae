This is a sandbox site that I created to help me to learn more about Wax. The collection and texts are all from http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/horae

# What is wax?
Wax is a minimal computing ([minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp)) project led by [Marii Nyr√∂p](http://marii.info/). It relies on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [Leaflet IIIF](https://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/), and [IIIF_S3](https://github.com/cmoa/iiif_s3), and builds upon work by [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex).

__Wax is an extensible workflow for producing scholarly exhibitions with minimal computing principles.__<br>
It's comprised of: __a few Ruby gems__ for processing image data and associated metadata ([wax_tasks](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_tasks/), [wax_iiif](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_iiif/)), __a Jekyll theme__ ([wax_theme](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_theme/)), and (hopefully soon!) a lot of __documentation and recipes__ for creating, deploying, and maintaining digital exhibitions ([wax_docs](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_docs/)).

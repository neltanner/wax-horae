__Wax is an extensible workflow for producing scholarly exhibitions with minimal computing principles.__<br>
It's comprised of: __a few Ruby gems__ for processing image data and associated metadata ([wax_tasks](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_tasks/), [wax_iiif](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_iiif/)), __a Jekyll theme__ ([wax_theme](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_theme/)), and (hopefully soon!) a lot of __documentation and recipes__ for creating, deploying, and maintaining digital exhibitions ([wax_docs](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_docs/)).

# Prerequisites


You'll need `Ruby >= 2.4` with `bundler` installed. Check your versions with:

```bash
$ ruby -v
  ruby 2.4.2p198 (2017-09-14 revision 59899) [x86_64-darwin15]

$ bundler -v
  Bundler version 1.16.1
```

To process images, you will also need to have ImageMagick and Ghostscript installed and functional. You can check to see if you have ImageMagick by running:

```bash
$ convert -version
  Version: ImageMagick 6.9.9-20 Q16 x86_64 2017-10-15 http://www.imagemagick.org
  Copyright: √Ç≈† 1999-2017 ImageMagick Studio LLC
```

... and check Ghostscript with:
```bash
$ gs -version
  GPL Ghostscript 9.21 (2017-03-16)

# Getting Started

__There are a few ways to get started with Wax, depending on your needs.__ You will need to decide in advance if you'd like to host your site with __GitHub Pages__, because GitHub pages does not allow Ruby gem Jekyll themes to be used on build. You will also need to know your skill level with Jekyll. Cloning the demo is suggested for new users so you can see how a full Wax site would work. __Advanced Jekyllers__ can start from a clean Jekyll install. 

### Option 1. Clone the demo for use with GitHub pages

1. Change directory into where you'd like your site, e.g., your Desktop:
    ```sh
    cd ~/Desktop
    ```
2. Clone this repository from the `gh-pages` branch:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/minicomp/wax.git -b 'gh-pages'
    ```
3. Change directory into the site repository and install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    cd wax
    bundle install
    ```
4. Serve the site locally
    ```sh
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

### Option 2. Clone the demo without using GitHub pages

1. Change directory into where you'd like your site, e.g., your Desktop:
    ```sh
    cd ~/Desktop
    ```
2. Clone this repository from the master branch:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/minicomp/wax.git -b master
    ```
3. Change directory into the site repository and install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    cd wax
    bundle install
    ```
4. Serve the site locally
    ```sh
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```
    
 When the demo site is serving correctly you're ready to swap in your own content and configuration to make your own exhibition site.
